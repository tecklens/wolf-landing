    question: "Can I use WOLFX free of charge?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can. If you send less than 10K events per month, 5 requests per second, then WOLFX is entirely free. Another option is to deploy the Open-Source version of WOLFX onto your own infrastructure, but that does not give you unique SLA and global redundancy we have in the Cloud version of WOLFX.",

    question:
      "What is a notification?",
    answer:
      "A notification is any message sent over any channel, after the WOLF logic engine, WOLF user preferences, and your configuration calculated and crafted the message. A notification can be sent to an email, In-App notification center, chat, push, and more.",

    question: "Can I send more than 1 million events a month on WOLF System?",
